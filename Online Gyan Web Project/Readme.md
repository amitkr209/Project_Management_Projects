# Online Gyan Web Development Project

Welcome to the Online Gyan Web Development Project repository!

The Online Gyan Web Development Project aimed to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website for customer interaction. As the project coordinator, I led the team to develop a comprehensive solution that included a responsive layout, content optimization, and ongoing maintenance for enhanced security and technological currency. This project involved conducting research on the target audience and competitor websites to inform design and functionality, ultimately improving the organization's digital presence.
