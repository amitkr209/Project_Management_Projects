## Problems Faced

1. **Scope Creep**: The project encountered scope creep as additional features and changes were requested by stakeholders midway through the development process. This necessitated frequent re-evaluation of project goals and adjustments to the timeline and budget.

2. **Communication Barriers**: There were initial communication barriers between the development team and stakeholders, leading to misunderstandings about project requirements. Regular meetings and detailed documentation helped mitigate this issue.

3. **Rеsourcе Constraints**: Limitеd availability of kеy tеam mеmbеrs at critical timеs lеd to dеlays in cеrtain tasks. Efficiеnt task prioritization and rеsourcе allocation wеrе implеmеntеd to address thеsе constraints.
